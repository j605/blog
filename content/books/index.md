I see that it is common to have a reading list.
This gives people recommendations of what to read under your own website.
I should thank [Jason](https://mjbraganza.com/books-ive-read/) and the [micro.blog](https://monday.micro.blog/2019/06/24/episode-greg-mcverry.html) podcast where [Greg McVerry](https://micro.blog/jgmac1106) talks about the IndieWeb which I have been trying to imbibe.
You can see that even at this page where it asks for [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).
So my plan is to list the books I've read and try to do reviews if possible.

# Currently Reading

* All About Love, New Visions by Bell Hooks.
* How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren.

A good summary of events that led up to how companies cooked books in the end of 20th century.
It is amazing that the fraudulent schemes described in the book are still being repeated in various forms.
See the games played by WeWork for example.
