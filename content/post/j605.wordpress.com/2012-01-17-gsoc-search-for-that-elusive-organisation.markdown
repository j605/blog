GSOC - Google Summer of Code provides the best opportunity for students to get involved in FOSS development. My search for an organisation lead me to different softwares written in different languages. My love lies in python. It was the first language that I learnt. I should give it to my sister who keeps inspiring me to learn new stuff. After some searching, mailman it was that was suggested to me. Being written in python it was quite obvious for me to research about. Installing from source, it is possible to have the latest source-code. Hope to code away this summer.
