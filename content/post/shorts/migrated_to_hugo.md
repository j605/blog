After a lot of thinking and trying out various static site generators I have
settled on using `hugo`. To be honest there was no particular preference other
than it being available in the Arch repository and migration was made easier
since I was able to use a WordPress exporter, [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp).

The post, https://samaxes.com/2016/02/static-site-from-wordpress-to-hugo/ was
helpful in nudging me to `hugo` as well. I did not bother with comments and other
complexities mentioned in that post although it can be useful for some. A somewhat
simpler solution can be engineered with `git hooks` to build and copy the site.
