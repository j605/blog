Working on the book 'think python' has given me lots of opportunities to learn by experimentation. This script is a result of such experimentation of an exercise already given in the book. The script [list duplicates](https://github.com/j605/learning-python/blob/master/list_duplicate_files.py) accepts two arguments. The first is the extension of the file and the next is the root directory. It uses the function os.path.walk(), which is very versatile. Further improvements of the script will follow.
