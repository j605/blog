I see that it is common to have a reading list.
This gives people recommendations of what to read under your own website.
I should thank [Jason](https://mjbraganza.com/books-ive-read/) and the [micro.blog](https://monday.micro.blog/2019/06/24/episode-greg-mcverry.html) podcast where [Greg McVerry](https://micro.blog/jgmac1106) talks about the IndieWeb which I have been trying to imbibe.
You can see that even at this page where it asks for [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).
So my plan is to list the books I've read and try to do reviews if possible.
