Mozilla, the organization behind Firefox actually does more than just build software.
In its advocacy efforts, they roped in [Veronica Belmont](https://twitter.com/Veronica)
to make [IRL: Online Life Is Real Life](https://irlpodcast.org/), a podcast that explores
various aspects of privacy in everyday life explained in a way that can be understood by
everyone. It is into the third season and the current episode takes a look at the dilemma
of sharing data with companies for free services and privacy.

# Nothing to hide
I was privacy conscious before but documentaries like ["Nothing to Hide"](https://vimeo.com/nothingtohide)
has opened my eyes towards the historical significance of privacy as well. People
who are generally in the opinion that since I am a normal person, I don't have to
fear surveillance should watch the documentary to gain more insight as to why
everyone has something to hide or at least would not be comfortable with it being public.

# Grand Bargain
Coming back to the topic of the IRL's recent episode, we have become quite accustomed
to accepting long terms of service agreements for online services. This extends to
application permissions that can be overreaching. We move past those in the hopes of
getting something out of those applications and in some cases we do. The episode takes
a dive into whether this is worth it and how it can have an impact on someone's life.

## Paying for privacy
Old methods and practices are always resurfaced as we find newfangled business models
are insufficient to handle privacy concerns. The question is if we pay for services,
will that buy us more privacy.

* Platforms like [patreon](https://www.patreon.com) offer a way for creators to reach
their fans directly and sustainably.
* Paying for a mail host gives us the confidence that they will maintain our mail
and are not in it for extraneous purposes.

It should be quite evident that paying for these services removes incentives for
companies to spy on users and concentrate on the product instead. To be honest,
I am not sure that everyone would be able to pay for every service we use for free
today. A lot of us use multiple news sources but paying for each of them can be
difficult.

### No one left behind
There is a real concern that the section of the internet users which is not able
to pay their way out of this will be disproportionately affected. Till now these
issues have not been looked at seriously because of online advertisement. But due
to increase in the use ad blockers we have had banners asking to disable the plugin
and allow tracking to view the content.

A straightforward solution will be to allow people to share subscriptions and make
them cheaper; family plans comes to mind. We should also realise nothing comes for
free and accept some loss of functionality by limiting our use to essential services.
More importantly by paying for those essential services we get more privacy!


## Middle ground between self hosting and advertisement driven services
Motivated individuals can maintain their own services on a personal server for a
small group of people. For example, personal mail servers was the norm in the 90s but it has
died out considerably due to amount of administrative burden and inherent complexity
of these services.

To this extent, I have seen a couple of groups popping up offering free services
powered through donations and free software that can help people move from ad-driven
services. [Disroot](https://disroot.org/en) and [Asymtote](https://asymptote.club/) are
examples that I found online. I believe forming groups among like-minded people
and creating such small services is the way forward. Importantly the author behind
Asymtote is keeping the infrastructure open so people can create clones and stand up
their own versions. Sharing of infrastructure can help with reducing costs and burden
with regards administration and [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

This post has been braindump of sorts but hopefully the links here and the podcast
can help people to think about these issues before signing up for more services and think
about self hosting as a cheaper alternative. If you have money, please pay someone rather
than using an ad-driven service for your own privacy and safety.
